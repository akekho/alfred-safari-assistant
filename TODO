New features:
	- Add settings command
		- Open help file
		- Open user scripts directory
		- Open list of ignored actions (if implemented)

	- Action "blacklist" to hide unwanted actions?
		⌘↩ on an action to ignore it
	- Also load iCloud tabs?
		Obviously a different type to Safari tabs. Could these be treated like
		URLs, or is a 3rd type necessary?
